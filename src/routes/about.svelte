  <h1 class="title">About Me</h1>
  <p>
    Life is short and I want to see how much I can explore and learn before I
    die! If you are curious about how I have time to code, design, model, study
    languages, and workout all while traveling the world, check out my
    <a href="blog">travel blog.</a>
  </p>
  <p>
    Looking for front-end development help on a project? Or perhaps a model for
    your brand? Want to get in shape and looking for a movement coach? I have
    experience freelancing in all of these fields so feel free to
    <a href="contact">shoot me a message</a>
    so we can talk more about your needs!

      <h3>Web Development And UI/UX Design</h3>
      <p>
        I have 5 years of experience with web development and design. Most of my
        recent projects are done in React, Vue, and Svelte (this website is made
        in Svelte). My specialty is making blazing fast e-commerce static sites
        with Gatsby and Shopify. Although I mostly do full-stack programming, I
        also have experience creating mockups in Sketch, Adobe XD and Figma.

      <h3>Translation</h3>
      <p>
        After studying abroad in Japan in 2004, I realized I had a passion for
        learning languages. I then went on to major in Japanese, live in Japan
        for 4 years, and then move to Korea for 6 years and learn Korean. During
        my time abroad, I had many opportunities to do freelance translation,
        interpretation, and subtitling work.

      <h3>Movement Coach</h3>
      <p>
        I am now well into my 30s yet never seemed to have outgrown my days at
        the playground. I have over 15 years experience in breakdancing, 5 years
        in calesthenic training, as well as experience in capoeira, acrobatics,
        stunt work, pole dancing, boxing, brazillian jujitsu, tricking,
        gymnastics, and parkour. I would love to help anyone else that wants to
        test the limits of their body and move like they never have before.
      </p>

      <h3>Modeling</h3>
      <p>
        I started modeling part-time in 2008. The majority of my work was
        product modeling at first but I later moved on to runway shows, event
        promotions, tv appearances, and extra work in movies.
      </p>

    <li class="work-item">
      <h3>Writing</h3>
      <p>
        I am by no means a professional when it comes to writing but I am
        currently in the process of writing 2 books. One is a childrens book and
        the other is a book about being a digital nomad. Once the books are
        published I will put up more information!
